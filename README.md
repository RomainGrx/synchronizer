Synchronizer
================

Synchronizer is a program that synchronize an original folder to another place every two days (by default). It sends notifications to your MacBook to let you know if the synchronization failed or not.

To use it, you just have to install packages and give to the program :
- `ORIGINALPATH` is the path to the folder you want to synchronize
- `COPYPATH` is the path to the synchronized folder
- `TIMETOWAIT` is the time between two synchronizations (in seconds)
